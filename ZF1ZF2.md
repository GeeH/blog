An Introduction to Zend Framework 2 for the Zend Framework 1 Developer
==

Having worked with ZF1 for a lot of years, I've been watching the development of ZF2 with interest. I've tried nearly every version, from the heady days of the pre-Skeleton App, right through the betas and release candidates.

With the imminent release of ZF2 proper, I thought I would share with you some of the most obvious differences between ZF1 and Zf2. Of course, these are only my opinions. While I've contributed (lightly), I've learned most of my ZF2 knowledge from hanging around in IRC and badgering people. If you want to learn quickly and have no remorse for annoying others, you should too!
